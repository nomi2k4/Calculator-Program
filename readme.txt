Calculator Program
A simple C++ program that simulates a calculator with basic arithmetic operations.

Overview
This program provides a menu-driven interface for users to perform addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and exponentiation operations on two numbers.

Features
- Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and exponentiation
- Handles division by zero error
- Provides a simple menu-driven interface

Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream)

Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator)
2. Run the program (e.g., ./calculator)
3. Follow the prompts to select an operation and enter two numbers
4. The program will display the result of the operation

Notes
- This program uses a simple switch statement to handle different operations. For larger programs, consider using more advanced techniques like polymorphism or function pointers.
- Error handling is minimal in this program. Consider adding checks for invalid user input or other potential errors.
